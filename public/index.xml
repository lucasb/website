      <description>Who am I ? Lucas is a technologist and has been leading the research, discovery, and creation of new technologies, with experience in big techs and startups.&#xA;I am a builder and strategist focused on the intersection of technical innovation and practical execution. Throughout my career, I have navigated the high-scale environments of Big Tech and the high-velocity world of startups. This dual perspective has shaped my belief that great technology isn&amp;rsquo;t just about elegant code—it’s about solving the right problems at the right time.</description>

      <description>Intro Why these settings matter for ASIDE remove_unused_columns=False: By default, the Trainer drops any data not in the standard model&amp;rsquo;s forward signature. Since you added role_mask to your Gemma3AsideWrapper, you must keep this False so the mask reaches your custom loss function. paged_adamw_8bit: Because Gemma 3’s embedding layer is massive (256k tokens), even the optimizer states for the embeddings can be heavy. This optimizer keeps the model snappy on a single GPU.</description>
