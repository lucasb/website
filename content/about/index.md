## Who am I ?

**Lucas is a technologist and has been leading the research, discovery, and creation of new technologies, with experience in big techs and startups.**

I am a builder and strategist focused on the intersection of technical innovation and practical execution. Throughout my career, I have navigated the high-scale environments of Big Tech and the high-velocity world of startups. This dual perspective has shaped my belief that great technology isn't just about elegant code—it’s about solving the right problems at the right time.

My primary interest lies in the "discovery" phase of technology: identifying emerging patterns and turning them into *scalable* solutions. I thrive on the challenge of taking a raw concept and *architecturalizing* it into a reality that provides genuine value. Having led research and development across various sectors, I’ve learned that the most successful systems are those that balance cutting-edge research with a pragmatic understanding of user needs.

I don’t just build for the sake of building; I aim to understand the underlying mechanics of how technology impacts business and society. Whether I'm leading a research team or implementing a new technology, my goal is to bridge the gap between "what is possible" and "what is useful."

## What is this Site ?

I started this site as a digital laboratory—a central repository for my thoughts on technology, leadership, and the shifting landscape of our industry. In an era of fleeting social media posts, I believe in the value of long-form thought and permanent URLs.

My current mission for this platform is centered on **exploring artificial cognition and its implications on software engineering and safety.**  This site is where I document my research into how these artificial cognitive architectures work and, more importantly, how we can build them to be robust, predictable, and safe. As well how it challenges the mental models of software development.

As I’ve progressed through my career, I’ve found that the best way to solidify my understanding of a complex topic is to write about it. This site serves as:

* **A Research Log:** Investigating the intersection of artificial cognition, user safety, and software engineering.

* **Safety & Engineering Essays:** Deep dives into building reliable systems in an age of non-deterministic model.

I value quality over frequency. I only publish when I feel I have a unique perspective or a refined piece of research to offer. My goal is to provide a signal in the noise of the modern tech landscape.

### To learn about new posts

I share my latest research and articles through a few specific channels:

	* **RSS Feed:** For the traditionalists who prefer a clean, chronological feed of updates without the interference of algorithms.
	* **LinkedIn:** Where I share more professional insights and engage with the broader tech community.
	* **Substack:** My Personal Newsletter — A curated digest of what I’m currently reading, building, and thinking about.
	* **Bluesky:** Snippets of the last updates from this website and other platforms.  

## Writing

Most of my recent intellectual output is hosted directly here. I believe in the "indie web" philosophy— owning my content and its presentation. My writing spans from deep technical dives into system architecture to high-level essays on the sociology implication of artificial cognitive and software technology.

In addition to this site, I have contributed to various industry publications and internal whitepapers at the companies I’ve served. My focus is always on clarity: taking the complex "new" and making it accessible and actionable.

## Speaking

I frequently share my findings at industry conferences and internal summits. My talks usually center on the process of technological discovery and implications on software engineering, security and safety. I enjoy the dialogue that comes from presenting a new idea to a room full of peers and having it challenged and refined.

I am also deeply committed to mentorship. Beyond the code and the research, I believe the most important thing we build as technologists is the next generation of thoughtful leaders.
