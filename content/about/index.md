## Who am I?

Bio: "Lucas is a technologist and has been leading the research, discovery, and creation of new technologies, with experience in big techs and startups."

I am Martin Fowler: an author, speaker… essentially a loud-mouthed pundit on the topic of software development, primarily for Enterprise Applications. I work for Thoughtworks, a software delivery company, where I have the exceedingly inappropriate title of “Chief Scientist”. I have written half-a-dozen books on software development, including Refactoring, and Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture. I write for and edit the website martinfowler.com.

My main interest is to understand how to design software systems, to maximize how much value development teams can deliver. In doing this I've looked to understand the patterns of good software architecture, and also the processes that support software design. I've become a big fan of agile approaches and the resulting focus on evolutionary software architecture. I don't come up with original ideas, but do a pretty good job of recognizing and packaging the ideas of others, or as Brian Foote describes me: “an intellectual jackal with good taste in carrion”.


## What is this Site?

I started martinfowler.com as a place to keep my own writings, initially just articles I'd written for other purposes. In the early 2000s, blogs got popular and that encouraged me to start the bliki in 2003 to engage with some more informal writing.

As the site got more popular, I felt I could use it to help other people get more visibility for their writing, so I've steadily increased publications from others here. I vet each article before accepting it - and often do a considerable amount of developmental editing too - so there isn't a high rate of publication. I do believe, however, that the quality of the articles matters much more than the quantity.

The topics of the articles I publish cover a broad range of software development, from writers who share my broad philosophy favoring agile approaches that appreciate the importance of technical skill in making that style work effectively. Many are, or have been, colleagues of mine at Thoughtworks, although that isn't mandatory. I generally only consider articles from people I know, although occasionally from those I don't but are vouched for by those I do.

### To learn about new posts

I post new material regularly to this site, and have a number of feeds that I use to let people know when this happens.

The best source is the site's RSS (Atom) Feed which you can subscribe to with any RSS reader. Although RSS is less well-known than when it was the heart of the blogging world, I still find that monitoring RSS feeds is one of the best ways to find out about new material on sites I like to read. You can also see all of my RSS posts on the recent changes page.

I also post about new material on several social media channels: Fediverse (Mastodon), Bluesky, LinkedIn, and X (Twitter) . Twitter used to be my primary place to post these updates, but it's declined in value considerably over the couple of years, so I'd recommend using one of the other channels.

## Writing

For the last decade or more, most of my writing has been published on martinfowler.com. I like the control I have to publish what I like, to control its format, and to evolve it as needed.

I have written several books, all of which published by Addison-Wesley, an imprint of Pearson. I am a series editor of my signature series with Addison-Wesley, which has given me chance to lend my support to several excellent books.

I spent five years in the early noughties as the editor of the design column for IEEE Software magazine. In the late 90s I wrote a column for Distributed Computing magazine. I rarely write for magazines now, preferring to concentrate my non-book writing on my website, which presumably you’ve found by now.

## Speaking

I was a regular speaker at many international conferences on software development. I’ve served on program committees for OOPSLA, Software Development, UML World, XP 2001, and TOOLS. I gave closing keynotes at XP2000-2003, served as conference chair for XP2005 and for Agile Universe in 2001. I retired from speaking in 2021 as it was never something I really enjoyed. Many of my conference talks are available on video.
